## Our Role

Project maintainers are here to help enforce these rules. They can take actions like removing harmful content or comments, or asking someone to stop behaving in a way that's not in line with this Code of Conduct.

## Where This Applies

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces and when you're representing the project or its community. This could be when using an official project email, posting on social media, or at events.

## Reporting Problems

If you see someone breaking these rules or if you're experiencing bad behavior, please let us know. You can email the project team at `hi@gptcorn.ai`. We'll keep your report private and look into the issue. We'll do what's needed to address the problem.

Project maintainers should follow this Code of Conduct too. If they don't, they may face consequences from other project leaders.

## Thanks

This Code of Conduct is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). We thank them for their work.
